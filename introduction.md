      </h2><p><em>"What I cannot create, I do not understand." Richard Feynman</em></p>
<p>Now is the best time to learn how to code - the number of learning resources has never been so high. You can choose from numerous reference guides, video courses, blog posts, books, and online boards (e.g. Stack Overflow).</p>
<p>We personally used (and still use) all of these resources while learning web development. An abundance of learning resources is a good thing, but it does not guarantee that you will become a good engineer. An abundance of resources and limited time force you to choose resources carefully. In other words, learning <em>how to learn</em> and <em>what to learn</em> has never been as important as it is today.</p>
<p>If you just started learning web development, then reference guides, video courses, and tutorials will help you get familiar with basic principles and syntax. Great resources will show you not only <em>how</em> to do something but also explain <em>why</em>.</p>
<p>Once you are familiar with principles and some syntax, the next step is to build your own web application. At this point, you've learned how to think logically like a developer, so you'll enjoy learning backend engineering as much as frontend. You will still use reference guides and other resources when you forget something or need to learn a new concept. However, despite the abundance of resources to learn the basics, the number of resources that teach you how to build a modern, large-scale, production-ready web application <em>from scratch</em> is relatively low.</p>
<p>We don't argue that everyone who learns coding should start with building a large project. But we do strongly suggest that developers - who have learned the basics and want to take the next step in advancing their web development skills - build a complete application from scratch. Since knowledge is organized as a tree-like structure, building one large web application will force you to glue all the disconnected pieces of knowledge you've learned into one, tree-like, systematic structure.</p>
<p>Say you've read about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You've followed tutorials, solved exercises, perhaps even cloned some large apps from Github and edited the code to learn how it works. You've learned a lot! However, at this point, the knowledge that you've acquired is fragmented. You've learned pieces of information here and there, but you haven't seen all that information used in one application. This fragmented knowledge is easy to forget and hard to apply. Building a large web application from scratch will help you see all of your knoweldge put together. Thus, our book.</p>
<p>This book walks you through building a modern web application from scratch. We wrote it because we wish we had a similar resource when we were learning how to build web apps. You will start from 0 lines of code in Chapter 1 and end up with over 12,000 lines of code by Chapter 8. In the end, you'll have your own production-ready web app, which you can add to your portfolio or even use to start a business.</p>
<p>You may have learned about server-side rendering, session, cookie, API endpoint, internal API, GET/POST methods, Promise, async/await, model, schema, index, routing, express, http, request/response, server/client, third-party APIs, lifecycle hooks, OAuth, and many other concepts. But have you ever put them all together into one working application?</p>
<p>To rephrase one popular meme</p>
<pre>Do you even lift, bro?</pre>
would be
<pre>Have you ever built a production-ready web application from scratch by yourself?</pre>

      </h2><p>This book assumes basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, React, and JavaScript. However, we've aimed to explain every line of code in our book. In cases where we do not describe a feature of JavaScript, React, or frameworks and packages that we use, we provide links for you to learn about them.</p>
<p>We provide a free preview for every chapter to help you decide whether this book is for you. You can see the following for free in each chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed table of contents with sections and subsections</li>
<li>Complete codebases for the chapter's start and end</li>
<li>List of packages discussed in the chapter</li>
<li>A preview of the chapter's beginning content</li>
</ul>
<p>To see a detailed list of all the technologies that you will learn, check out <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/builderbook/builderbook/blob/master/package.json" rel="noopener noreferrer">package.json</a>.</p>
<p>This book will be a great resource if you have a basic level of experience with React and JavaScript. Perhaps you worked on a large project with someone but never built one by yourself. Perhaps you wrote an asynchronous callback using <code>Promise.then</code> but you prefer <code>async/await</code>. If so, this book will help you organize many unrelated concepts that you've learned from reference guides and tutorials into a single system.</p>

      </h2><p>In this book, you will build your own production-ready web application (see the project structure below). Throughout the book, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>get familar with React, Next.js, and Material-UI</li>
<li>create an Express server and Session</li>
<li>connect your app to MongoDB with the help of Mongoose</li>
<li>add Google OAuth 2.0 for user authentication</li>
<li>integrate your app with third-party applications: Github, Stripe, AWS SES, and Mailchimp</li>
<li>create User, Book, Chapter, EmailTemplate, and Purchase models</li>
<li>write dozens of static methods for these models, as well as for Express routes and API methods</li>
<li>write dozens of pages, components, and more</li>
</ul>
<p>You could spend weeks searching these topics on Google. Our book puts everything about building a web app into one place.</p>

      </h2><p>In this book, you will build your own <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/builderbook/builderbook" rel="noopener noreferrer">Builder Book app</a>. This website itself is a Builder Book app! You are welcome to add the final app you build in this book to your portfolio or resume. You can even use it to start a business.</p>
<p>The main use cases for this app, besides learning, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>to write and host free  documentation</li>
<li>to write, host, and sell books</li>
</ul>
<p>The app has two primary users, <code>Customer</code> and <code>Admin</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Customer user reads chapters (for free or buys a book)</li>
<li>the Admin user writes content and hosts content (free or paid) on his/her website</li>
</ul>
<p>The app uses both server-side and client-side rendering. For initial load, pages are rendered by the server; for subsequent loads, pages are rendered on the client.</p>
<p>Below are screenshots of the main pages you'll build for your app.</p>
